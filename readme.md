# Recognize text in an image
Uses a keylogger to recognize text in an image (using the current system language)
The image saved in the clipboard, I personally use the utility in conjunction with Lightshot https://app.prntscr.com/ru/download .html
Required files from https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata which are stored by default on C:\tessdata.
By default, the hotkey is LCtrl + M.
The text is translated from the current system language to another (the logic is implemented only for 2 languages).

For Windows, .NET Framework 4.8
